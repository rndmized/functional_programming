#lang racket

; Write a function lstq in Racket that takes as arguments two lists l and m of equal
; length and containing numbers. It should return d, the distance given by the sum of
; the square residuals between the numbers in the lists:
; d = Xi (li âˆ’ mi)2
; This means take the ith element of m from the ith element of l and square the result
; for all i. Then add all of those to get d. For example:
; > (lstq (list 4.5 5.1 6.2 7.8) (list 1.1 -0.1 6.1 3.8))
; 54.61


; subtract elements of the list in a given position and square them, then add them together.

(define (residual-sum n1 n2) (* (- n1 n2) (- n1 n2)))

(define (lstq l1 l2) (if(null? l1) 
                                0      
                                (+ (residual-sum (car l1) (car l2)) (lstq (cdr l1) (cdr l2)))
                            ))

(lstq (list 4.5 5.1 6.2 7.8) (list 1.1 -0.1 6.1 3.8))
